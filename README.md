# Multimodal Data Processor üß†üìÑüñºÔ∏è

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using the **Google Gemini API** to process, index, and query information from various file types, including **text, PDF documents, and images**.

The application is built with **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use web interface, allowing users to upload documents and ask natural language questions about the consolidated content.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multimodal Input:** Processes various files (text, PDF, JPG, PNG).
* **Context Building:** Combines all processed content into a single context for the Gemini model.
* **Natural Language Querying (LLM):** Uses the `gemini-2.5-flash` model to answer complex questions based *only* on the uploaded documents.
* **Secure API Handling:** Uses environment variables to securely manage the API key.
* **Web Interface:** Easy file uploads and chat interface powered by Streamlit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.9+**
2.  **A Gemini API Key** (Obtainable for free from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)).

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository (or navigate to the folder)

If you downloaded the files, navigate to the `Multi Modal System` folder.

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

streamlit run main_app.py
